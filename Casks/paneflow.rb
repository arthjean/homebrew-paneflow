# PaneFlow Homebrew cask — canonical template.
#
# US-017. This file is the SOURCE OF TRUTH that
# `.github/workflows/update-cask.yml` copies (and version-stamps) into
# the external tap repo `ArthurDEV44/homebrew-paneflow` on every
# release. The tap repo's `Casks/paneflow.rb` is a derived artifact; do
# not hand-edit it — commit changes here instead and let the workflow
# propagate on the next release.
#
# Operator setup (one-time):
#   1. Create the public repo https://github.com/ArthurDEV44/homebrew-paneflow
#   2. Initialise it with an empty `Casks/` directory (`git init && mkdir
#      Casks && git commit -m "bootstrap"`).
#   3. Create a fine-grained GitHub PAT scoped to that repo with
#      `contents: read-and-write`, add it to this repo's Actions secrets
#      as `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`.
#   4. The next release (update_cask.yml chains off the `release`
#      workflow's completion via workflow_run) will render + push the
#      tap's `Casks/paneflow.rb`. The tap was bootstrapped manually for
#      v0.3.4 on 2026-05-28; the workflow keeps it current thereafter.

  # `arch` maps Homebrew's Ruby-level `arch` helper (which already
  # distinguishes Apple Silicon vs Intel at `brew install` time) onto the
  # Rust target-triple tail PaneFlow uses in its .dmg filenames. The same
  # string is interpolated into `url` below via `#{arch}` — so there is a
  # single URL template, not two, and any typo is caught at cask-load
  # time by Homebrew's `brew style` linter.

  # These three lines are rewritten on every release by the CI workflow.
  # The placeholders keep the file syntactically valid (so `brew style`
  # passes in CI) and flag that a human-edited version is stale.
